This hobby project is derived from [Adafruit_SSD1306](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306) project, although it has been widely modified to accommodate specific needs.

Please read the README file in `./tools` for an explanation of how to create fonts and images using the tool therein.

Have fun!
